<h3> What they did ... </h3>
Honda designed a two-sided interactive film that enabled viewers to switch between stories about a suburban school-run and an art heist by typing “R” on their keyboards – a function that mirrors the Type R’s race button. There is a video synopsis available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO5OTCxGCto"> here. </a>
