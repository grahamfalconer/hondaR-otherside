<h3> What I'm doing... </h3>
In this project I will be looking at the custom video player used in the 2015 Honda Civic R video campaign and see how they achieved creating such a powerful marketing tool through providing a unique video playback experience. I will then try to recreate my own version of the video player using JS & HTML.

<h3> What they did ... </h3>
Honda designed a two-sided interactive film that enabled viewers to switch between stories about a suburban school-run and an art heist by typing “R” on their keyboards – a function that mirrors the Type R’s race button. There is a video synopsis available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO5OTCxGCto"> here. </a>
