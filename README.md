<h1> HondaR-Otherside </h1>

In this project I will be looking at the custom video player used in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO5OTCxGCto"> 2015 Honda Civic R Video Campaign </a> and see how they achieved creating such a powerful marketing tool through providing a unique video playback experience. I will then try to recreate my own version of the video player using JS & HTML.

<h2> What they did ... </h2>
Honda designed a two-sided interactive film that enabled viewers to switch between stories about a suburban school-run and an art heist by typing “R” on their keyboards – a function that mirrors the Type R’s race button. Experience it <a href="http://wklondon.com/work/the-other-side/"> here </a> (works best in Safari).
